# Frameplicity

Are you a new web developer who is struggling to learn a back-end web framework? Are you overwhelmed by its complexity? When you code with it, are you "filling in the blanks" without understanding what is going on behind the scenes?

If so, then you should learn Frameplicity, an educational web framework that's designed to help you master fundamental framework skills. It contains less than 650 lines of code (excluding comments), allowing you to explore it from the ground-up and under-the-hood.

Frameplicity is designed for you, the learner-- In fact, it's not meant to be deployed in production. It's solely an educational tool.

The framework may seem complex at first. That's because you're learning it from the inside-out. It's much simpler than the well known, enterprise grade web frameworks that you couldn't possibly learn from the inside-out. 

You learn Frameplicity by completing activities. These activities ask you use the framework and also extend its core functionality(*). After mastering the framework, you will understand the fundamentals of templates, page routing, partials, component architecture and inversion of control. This knowledge will ease your transition to more advanced frameworks.

(*) Currently Frameplicity is in beta and the activities do not involve extending the framework. Such activities are planned for development at a later time.
