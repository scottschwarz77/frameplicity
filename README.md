# Frameplicity
Are you a new web developer who is struggling to learn your first framework? Are you overwhelmed by its complexity? When you code with it, are you "filling in the blanks" without understanding what is going on behind the scenes?

If so, then you should learn Frameplicity, an educational web framework that's designed to help you master fundamental framework skills. It contains less than 650 lines of code (excluding comments), allowing you to explore it "under-the-hood".

Frameplicity may seem complex at first. But it's much simpler than the well known, enterprise grade web frameworks. You learn Frameplicity by completing activities. These activities ask you use the framework and also extend its core functionality*.

After mastering the framework, you will understand the fundamentals of templates, page routing, partials, component architecture and inversion of control. This knowledge will ease your transition to more advanced frameworks.

Frameplicity is currently in beta and isn't meant to be used in a production environment. It's solely an educational tool.

The code in this repository contains the activity files you will need to learn the framework.

* Currently the activities do not involve extending the framework. This is planned for a later time.
